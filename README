NAME
    Data::Format::Pretty::PHPSerialization - Pretty-print data structure as
    PHP serialization format

VERSION
    version 0.02

SYNOPSIS
     use Data::Format::Pretty::PHPSerialization qw(format_pretty);
     print format_pretty($data);

    Some example output:

    *   format_pretty({a=>1, b=>2})

         a:2:{s:1:"a";i:1;s:1:"b";i:2;}

DESCRIPTION
    This module uses PHP::Serialization to encode data as PHP serialization
    format, which I frankly wouldn't call as a "pretty" format, but added
    for completeness sake (used by e.g. Sub::Spec::HTTP::Server).

FUNCTIONS
  format_pretty($data, \%opts)
    Return formatted data structure as PHP serialization format. Currently
    there are no known options.
